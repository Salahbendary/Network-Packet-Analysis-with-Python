# Network Packet Analysis with Python

This project provides tools and scripts for analyzing network packets from PCAP files. Using Python, it processes packet data, performs various analyses, and generates visualizations to help understand network traffic patterns. The analysis includes protocol detection, traffic rate calculations, latency measurement, and packet loss detection.

## Features

- **PCAP File Processing**: Upload and parse PCAP files to extract network packet information.
- **Protocol Detection**: Identify and classify protocols such as SIP, RTP, TCP, and UDP.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Aggregate and visualize network traffic rates over time.
- **Latency Measurement**: Calculate and plot packet latency (time delta) for performance insights.
- **Packet Loss Detection**: Detect and report packet loss and retransmissions.
